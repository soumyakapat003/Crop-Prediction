# Crop-Prediction
Here I made a Crop Prediction Machine Learning Model by using Python.

In this project, I have made a model using a supervised machine learning algorithms for crops prediction.
I have used four model in this project. These are the models I have used-
(i) Random forest
(ii) Decision tree
(iii) K nearest neighbors
(iv) Logistic regression
